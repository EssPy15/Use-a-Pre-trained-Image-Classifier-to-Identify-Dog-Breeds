Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, the three model architectures correctly classified Dog_01.jpg as 'chihuahua'.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg as 'chihuahua'.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: VGG and ResNet classified the image correctly as 'penguin' while AlexNet classified as 'albatross'. All three models classified object correctly as 'coffee mug'. 


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Both VGG and ResNet classified all pictures correctly while AlexNet classified penguin as albatross(which is wrong). Overall ResNet did a better job as it's runtime is 1 sec while of VGG is 5 sec.
